<h1>MINIMUM OPERATIONS</h1>
<p>In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.</p>
<p>Prototype: def minOperations(n)</p>
<p>Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
Example:</p>

<p>n = 9 H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6</p>
